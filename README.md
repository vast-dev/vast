# Vast

Vast is a framework for building RESTful backends using nothing but JSON files to define the endpoints, schemas and even the logic. This opens up interesting possibilities for developer user interfaces, as apps no longer need to be built in an IDE. UIs for controlling the JSON could take any form and be optimized for specific use cases, industries or tasks. 

Imagine building an entire backend API via a mobile app, in a few minutes...

...or working in realtime with a team of 5 in a virtual reality environment where apps, endpoints and tables take on 3D forms...

The possibilities are V A S T.
